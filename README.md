`A boat, beneath a sunny sky,`

`Lingering onward dreamily`

`In an evening of July—`

`Children three that nestle near,`

`Eager eye and willing ear,`

`Pleased a simple tale to hear.`

`Long has paled that sunny sky:`

`Echoes fade and memories die:`

`Autumn frosts have slain July.`

`Ever drifting down the stream—`

`Lingering in the golden gleam—`

`Life, what is it but a dream?`
